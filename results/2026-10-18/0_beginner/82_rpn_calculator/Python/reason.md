# Task B selection — 82_rpn_calculator / Python

The selected input lines identify expressions 2 and 3. Token recognition accepts only the exact operator tokens, so -17 and -3 are parsed as numbers, while a standalone minus is subtraction. The last stack item is the right operand and the next is the left. For these small integer operands, / produces the quotient as a float and int then truncates it toward zero. The successive operation results of expression 2 are -3, -12, and 9. In expression 3 the addition leaves only 3 on the stack; the following * hits the fewer-than-two guard and exits the token loop or evaluation function before the trailing token 3. Later expression literals and result presentation provide no trace evidence.

Selected complete source lines: 1, 3, 4, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32.

With the benchmark tokenizer, this selection measures 282 tokens; the previous selection measured 284. The full source is 527 tokens.

## Current token measurement

Task A: **524 tokens**. Task B: **279 tokens**. Remeasured with `metric/tokenizer.py`, which counts contiguous `()` as one token. Earlier numerical token comparisons in this rationale are historical and are superseded by these totals; the selected source lines and answer requirements remain the basis of the rationale.
