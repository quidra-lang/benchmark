# Task B selection: 40_binary_search / Julia

Trace the probes and bound updates for the given target, show why the sentinel stays unset, and derive the complete output.

Starting with bounds (0, 15), probe 7 (31) and raise the lower bound to 8; probe 11 (53) and lower the upper bound to 10; probe 9 (42) and raise the lower bound to 10; probe 10 (47) and raise it to 11. The interval is now empty, so the loop stops without setting the success index. The output is `50: probes 7 11 9 10 -> not found`.

The question provides target 50, but the searched array and the index arithmetic must come from source. The equality assignment and result test show that a failed search leaves the original sentinel. Probe recording and string joining or sequential writes fix the output spacing. The success-only break or output body is unnecessary for this trace.

Array lookup uses the zero-based probe plus one to address the one-based array; the recorded probe itself stays zero-based.
