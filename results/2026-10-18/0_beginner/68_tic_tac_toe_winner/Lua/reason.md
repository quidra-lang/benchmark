# Task B selection: 68_tic_tac_toe_winner / Lua

## Common answer requirements

Identify the line by which board 6 wins despite being full and show why board 4 is a draw.

## Supported analysis

The sixth board is XOX/OXO/OXX and has X on the main diagonal (flat positions 0,4,8). The fourth is XOX/XOO/OXX: it has no dots and no all-equal nonempty row, column, or diagonal. The line data or construction and the match test establish this. The selected decision chooses a win over the draw fallback, either by an early winning result or by overriding an earlier fallback. This is result precedence; the fallback may be eagerly evaluated.

## Minimization and alternatives

Keep the fixture entries that establish board positions and the full candidate-line search. Table delimiters and boundaries of blocks used by later retained operations matter; standalone trailing control terminators do not. The prior selection used 509 tokens; this selection uses 511 tokens. Task A is assumed to satisfy its requirements for this analysis, as specified in README §2.3.
