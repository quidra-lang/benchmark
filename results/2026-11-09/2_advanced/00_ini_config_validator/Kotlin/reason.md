# Task B — schema size normalization

The same answer requirements apply in every language: identify the size spelling grammar and case-insensitive binary unit scale; follow exact decimal-to-byte arithmetic and its failure exit; trace 1.5MB and 0.05KB; identify the successful source value representation and the normalization/error boundary; show how optional range bounds consume that successful numeric value, in order. Includes, inheritance, interpolation implementation and other scalar types are outside this routine-level question.

## Kotlin source evidence

`scalar` returns Value? and its size arm constructs Value(kind,number=number), whose declared number field is Long. Regex.matchEntire and the factor map establish syntax and scale. normalize uses the null-elvis throw typeError path before checkRange and returning Value. Bounds use the same scalar parser and requireNotNull(...).number; the byte measure comes from value.number and strict comparisons preserve inclusive endpoints. Long modulo/division ensures exact accepted fractions.

For 1.5MB the whole part contributes 1×1048576 and the fractional part contributes (5×1048576)/10 = 524288 exactly, giving 1572864 integer bytes. For 0.05KB the fractional numerator is 5×1024 = 5120 with divisor 100; the nonzero remainder rejects the value before any range comparison. This becomes E_TYPE, not a rounded 51-byte value. A successful value is checked against any nonempty size bounds in the same byte unit; strict less-than/greater-than rejection makes equality acceptable. Without a range failure it crosses the normalization return boundary; the first failed parse or range check stops that operation.

## Necessity and alternatives

- `main.kt`: 6, 20, 29, 31, 32, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272, 273, 274, 275, 276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 282, 283, 284, 285, 286, 287, 288, 290, 291, 292, 293, 294, 295, 296, 297

The parser body is required because a name or return type alone cannot establish exact-byte divisibility, accepted spellings or unit factors. The selected dispatch, failure/return and range-consumer lines connect that computation to the requested operation. Type/standard-library conversion guarantees are used instead of copying their implementations; custom helpers needed to establish the grammar or arithmetic are retained. Whole scalar dispatches, list/string/date algorithms, callers that only carry an already expanded string, include processing and inheritance were considered and excluded because they add no evidence for these answer requirements. Diagnostic escaping/rendering internals are unnecessary to identify the first diagnostic code and precedence, so no exact escaped diagnostic text is claimed.

The excerpt has 1283 tokens under `metric/tokenizer.py`; omitting blank lines saves tokens over contiguous function blocks. A fresh excerpt-only review checked the grammar/constants, fractional rejection, success representation, parse-before-range precedence and range use against each requirement. No proposed program change was implemented, and this source review makes no compilation or runtime-correctness claim.
