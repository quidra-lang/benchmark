# Task B selection — Julia

## Answer requirements shared across languages

1. Explain recognition of @@ -oldRange +newRange @@, signed range splitting, decimal parsing, omitted count1 and start0 permitted only for count0.
2. Trace context/deletion/addition body consumption against both counts and construction of the parsed hunk.
3. Compare X and X,0; distinguish malformed header, truncated body, bad/overflowing body and no-change errors with their reported line.

## Evidence and language semantics

Anchored NUMBER_PAIR, nothing capture and parse(Int) distinguish omitted count1 from0. Header constructs the hunk with empty BodyLine vector. The one-based parse loop retains header index for truncated/no-changes errors and uses the current index for malformed body lines before returning hunks. A range X means startX,count1; X,0 means startX,count0 and consumes no line on that side. Thus0 alone is invalid, while0,0 is allowed by the range parser. Space-prefixed context contributes to both counts, minus only old and plus only new; parsing continues until both declared counts are met. EOF while either remains produces truncated hunk at the original header line; a malformed range/delimiter produces bad hunk header at that header, and an encountered invalid or overflowing body line produces bad hunk line at its own line. A new @@ line encountered before the body counts are met is a bad hunk line rather than EOF truncation. A body with no additions/deletions, including both counts zero, fails no changes. Hunk application, matching offsets/fuzz, document mutation and diff generation are outside this parse operation and were excluded.

## Minimization and alternatives

Each selected expression establishes a requested fact or its data dependency. The excerpt was read without unselected implementation details: removing the kind extraction, bounds/coordinate/default condition, state update, or output expression would lose that fact. A larger enclosing routine, unrelated commands, declarations with inferable types, and implementations of standard primitives were considered and excluded; no alternative smaller expression in this source establishes the same facts. Complete lines retain their original syntax even when one line includes incidental text.

The excerpt contains 995 tokens under `metric/tokenizer.py`. Only complete source lines are counted; the question and this rationale are excluded. Task B uses the README assumption that the Task A program satisfies its contract; this selection does not claim compilation or runtime verification.
