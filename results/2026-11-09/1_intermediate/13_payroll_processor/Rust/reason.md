# Task B selection — Rust

## Answer requirements shared across languages

1. Identify the daily Sunday-or-holiday selection predicate.
2. Determine the immediate regular, overtime, and double-time minutes for a matching day, without expanding weekly computation.

## Selected source locations

- `main.rs`: 256, 257, 258

## Evidence and language semantics

special is day % 7 == 0 OR self.holidays.contains(&day). The if-expression branch destructured into (regular,overtime,double) is (0,0,worked).

## Minimization and alternatives

Retain only the predicate and immediate assigned values. Positional results additionally require the smallest available source mapping to category names; named records or bindings need no such caller expansion. Worked-time calculation, normal-day formulas and weekly adjustments are outside the requested immediate branch. Zero-initialization is retained where zeros are implicit.

The excerpt contains 66 tokens under `metric/tokenizer.py`. Only complete source lines are counted; the question and this rationale are excluded. Task B uses the README assumption that the Task A program satisfies its contract; this selection does not claim compilation or runtime verification.
