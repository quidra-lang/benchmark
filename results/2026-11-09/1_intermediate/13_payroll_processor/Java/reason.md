# Task B selection — Java

## Answer requirements shared across languages

1. Identify the daily Sunday-or-holiday selection predicate.
2. Determine the immediate regular, overtime, and double-time minutes for a matching day, without expanding weekly computation.

## Selected source locations

- `Main.java`: 103, 104, 239, 240

## Evidence and language semantics

The predicate is day % 7 == 0 OR holidays.contains(day). Daily record component order gives regular=0, overtime=0 and doubleTime=worked.

## Minimization and alternatives

Retain only the predicate and immediate assigned values. Positional results additionally require the smallest available source mapping to category names; named records or bindings need no such caller expansion. Worked-time calculation, normal-day formulas and weekly adjustments are outside the requested immediate branch. Zero-initialization is retained where zeros are implicit.

The excerpt contains 102 tokens under `metric/tokenizer.py`. Only complete source lines are counted; the question and this rationale are excluded. Task B uses the README assumption that the Task A program satisfies its contract; this selection does not claim compilation or runtime verification.
