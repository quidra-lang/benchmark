# Task B selection — Zig

## Answer requirements shared across languages

1. Identify the CUP/HVP-only branch and both parameter sources with omitted/zero defaults.
2. Explain exchanging parameter roles for column;row while preserving origin-relative row addressing, row/column clamping and all other cursor-command semantics.

## Selected source locations

- `main.zig`: 197, 198, 199, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 797, 798, 799, 800, 932, 933, 934, 935, 936, 937

## Evidence and language semantics

H/f map to cursor_position and d separately to cursor_row. parameter gives missing0, amount first>=1; addressRow retains DECOM offset and row clamp. Within H/f only, send max(second_parameter,1) through the existing row-address helper, and send max(first_parameter,1) through the width clamp for column. Preserve the helper's origin-mode top+row-1 and bottom/screen-height cap. J additionally retains its final zero-based adjustment. Do not alter the shared parameter/amount helper or swap the parsed array globally: other cursor branches shown keep their existing first-parameter use. The alternative of reading full CSI parsing, mode mutation and screen rendering is unnecessary to explain this local change.

## Minimization and alternatives

Each selected expression establishes a requested fact or its data dependency. The excerpt was read without unselected implementation details: removing the kind extraction, bounds/coordinate/default condition, state update, or output expression would lose that fact. A larger enclosing routine, unrelated commands, declarations with inferable types, and implementations of standard primitives were considered and excluded; no alternative smaller expression in this source establishes the same facts. Complete lines retain their original syntax even when one line includes incidental text.

The excerpt contains 358 tokens under `metric/tokenizer.py`. Only complete source lines are counted; the question and this rationale are excluded. Task B uses the README assumption that the Task A program satisfies its contract; this selection does not claim compilation or runtime verification.
