# Task B selection — C#

## Answer requirements shared across languages

1. Identify the actual command-error exit path and the control-flow edge permitting subsequent waitlist processing.
2. Determine whether that edge depends on command success.

## Selected source locations

- `Program.cs`: 893, 894, 895, 896, 897

## Evidence and language semantics

The CommandError catch emits ERROR and ends normally. ProcessWaitlist follows the catch unconditionally; that edge does not depend on command success.

## Minimization and alternatives

The selected error-reporting exit and immediately following queue edge answer the local question. Waitlist admission internals, unrelated command cases and success-output construction cannot change this control-flow fact. For plain-return implementations, a concrete command return and its caller are needed; for caught errors the catch/fallthrough itself suffices. Zig's explicit failure branch is smaller and more direct than its successful-command path.
