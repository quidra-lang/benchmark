# Task B selection — Java

## Answer requirements shared across languages

1. Locate the first-reveal SAFETY block exclusion and describe replacing its square-neighborhood test by a cell-plus-orthogonal-neighbors test, leaving cell/none branches unchanged.
2. Show that candidate construction visits in-board cells in row-major order and retains that order for the existing random-index selection/removal procedure.
3. Trace storage of a determined placement and the guard preventing later re-placement.
4. Establish that RESTART and UNDO restore play/history fields without clearing or recomputing determined mines.

## Selected source locations

- `Main.java`: 117, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 178, 179, 422, 454, 455, 456, 457, 458

## Evidence and language semantics

Ascending cells generate row-major candidates, and List.remove(index) both selects and stably removes the chosen cell. Only Safety.BLOCK changes. determined is preserved by restart and UNDO; revealed/marks/history are the fields restored.

## Minimization and alternatives

For block mode, retain exactly candidates with |dx|+|dy|>1; the loop already bounds every candidate to the board, so diagonals become eligible and edge/corner neighbors need no separate out-of-board insertion. The candidate-filter-only alternative is smaller but cannot establish the required unchanged random procedure or placement persistence. Including generic neighbor enumeration or flood-fill would be larger and could misleadingly suggest changing game adjacency; those operations are unaffected. Random constants and removal operations are retained where they are local to placement; recalculating adjacency numbers and all output formatting are omitted because they do not choose candidates or discard placement. Excerpt-only review confirms the four requirements from the filter, ordered construction/removal, storage/guard, and reset/undo mutation boundaries.

The excerpt contains 650 tokens under `metric/tokenizer.py`. Only complete source lines are counted; the question and this rationale are excluded. Task B uses the README assumption that the Task A program satisfies its contract; this selection does not claim compilation or runtime verification.
