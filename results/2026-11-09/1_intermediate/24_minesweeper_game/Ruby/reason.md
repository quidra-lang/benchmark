# Task B selection — Ruby

## Answer requirements shared across languages

1. Locate the first-reveal SAFETY block exclusion and describe replacing its square-neighborhood test by a cell-plus-orthogonal-neighbors test, leaving cell/none branches unchanged.
2. Show that candidate construction visits in-board cells in row-major order and retains that order for the existing random-index selection/removal procedure.
3. Trace storage of a determined placement and the guard preventing later re-placement.
4. Establish that RESTART and UNDO restore play/history fields without clearing or recomputing determined mines.

## Selected source locations

- `main.rb`: 75, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 150, 154, 155, 435, 436, 473, 474, 475, 477, 478

## Evidence and language semantics

The range select preserves ascending linear IDs. Replace the block when expression while keeping none/cell and delete_at. determined is set once and used by reveal; restart and UNDO preserve mine placement.

## Minimization and alternatives

For block mode, retain exactly candidates with |dx|+|dy|>1; the loop already bounds every candidate to the board, so diagonals become eligible and edge/corner neighbors need no separate out-of-board insertion. The candidate-filter-only alternative is smaller but cannot establish the required unchanged random procedure or placement persistence. Including generic neighbor enumeration or flood-fill would be larger and could misleadingly suggest changing game adjacency; those operations are unaffected. Random constants and removal operations are retained where they are local to placement; recalculating adjacency numbers and all output formatting are omitted because they do not choose candidates or discard placement. Excerpt-only review confirms the four requirements from the filter, ordered construction/removal, storage/guard, and reset/undo mutation boundaries.

The excerpt contains 418 tokens under `metric/tokenizer.py`. Only complete source lines are counted; the question and this rationale are excluded. Task B uses the README assumption that the Task A program satisfies its contract; this selection does not claim compilation or runtime verification.
