# Task B selection — J

## Answer requirements shared across languages

1. Trace requested payload size and alignment through rounded internal size, free placeable-block selection and the unchanged leading-fragment rule.
2. Identify trailing split and used-block-size changes for threshold24, explain remainders16 and24, and derive the NEXT rover from actual used extent.
3. Explain why BUDDY splitting and its size rounding are unchanged.

## Evidence and language semantics

required rounds8-byte units+8 with Mode5 minimum32 power2. allocate builds aligned free candidates, ranks them by mode, then splits. The non-BUDDY (b-s)>:16 condition130 changes; leading95 and Mode5 halves remain. NEXT Rover=S|p+b uses actual used size. Only the free-list trailing remainder threshold changes from16 to24. Let required internal size be S and available aligned suffix be A. A-S=16 is now absorbed, so used size A=S+16 and no tail exists; A-S=24 is split, so used size S and a24-byte free tail remains. NEXT rover is the end of that actual used block, wrapping at heap size: it advances16 farther in the absorbed16 case, and points at the tail in the24 case. Preserve payload rounding/alignment, free-fit choice, leading-fragment16 rule and separate BUDDY powers/halves. Where one condition controls both size and split, edit that one; where two equivalent expressions exist, keep both consistent. Global MIN_BLOCK replacement and realloc/coalescing code were considered and excluded because this proposal targets allocation trailing splitting, not every16-byte rule.

## Minimization and alternatives

Each selected expression establishes a requested fact or its data dependency. The excerpt was read without unselected implementation details: removing the kind extraction, bounds/coordinate/default condition, state update, or output expression would lose that fact. A larger enclosing routine, unrelated commands, declarations with inferable types, and implementations of standard primitives were considered and excluded; no alternative smaller expression in this source establishes the same facts. Complete lines retain their original syntax even when one line includes incidental text.

The excerpt contains 694 tokens under `metric/tokenizer.py`. Only complete source lines are counted; the question and this rationale are excluded. Task B uses the README assumption that the Task A program satisfies its contract; this selection does not claim compilation or runtime verification.
