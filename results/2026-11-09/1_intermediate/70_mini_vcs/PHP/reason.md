# Task B selection — PHP

## Answer requirements shared across languages

1. Identify the ancestry predicate selecting Already up to date in MERGE.
2. Use the local exit or exclusive branch structure and uncommitted-check position to explain whether that path bypasses the check; distinguish literal return from equivalent branch exclusion.

## Selected source locations

- `main.php`: 756, 757, 758, 759, 763, 764

## Evidence and language semantics

$old=$this->head(); ancestor($target,$old) selects Already up to date. The mutually exclusive elseif/else structure bypasses checkUncommitted in the final else; there is no literal early return in this implementation.

## Minimization and alternatives

Only the ancestry predicate, result/exit or exclusive branch boundaries, and the later cleanliness call are needed. The full merge procedure, ancestry traversal implementation, fast-forward mutations and conflict processing are unnecessary: the question concerns which predicate is used and its local control-flow ordering, not how ancestry is computed.

The excerpt contains 113 tokens under `metric/tokenizer.py`. Only complete source lines are counted; the question and this rationale are excluded. Task B uses the README assumption that the Task A program satisfies its contract; this selection does not claim compilation or runtime verification.
