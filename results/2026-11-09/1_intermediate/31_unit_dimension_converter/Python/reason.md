# Task B selection — Python

## Answer requirements shared across languages

1. Establish exact-symbol lookup before prefix decomposition, including the factor/dimension returned by a prefix match.
2. Connect DEFINE name rejection to the same resolver and explain why a name absent as an exact entry may still be taken.
3. Identify the restriction preventing prefixes on user-defined units.
4. Determine whether UNDEF of a referenced user unit changes another unit already defined from it, using stored factor/dimension and the deletion operation.

## Selected source locations

- `main.py`: 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 511, 512, 513, 514, 515, 516, 517, 518, 519, 520, 521, 522, 523, 524, 525, 526, 668, 669, 671, 672, 673, 674, 677, 678, 679, 685, 686, 687, 692

## Evidence and language semantics

find compares whole symbols and resolve returns exact factor/dimension before prefix scanning. The selected constructor maps the False argument to prefixable. DEFINE stores calculated factor and dimension fields, whereas UNDEF only removes the found object; it neither mutates another unit nor resolves its saved expression again.

## Minimization and alternatives

Compared with selecting the whole unit-expression parser or arithmetic library, the resolver plus DEFINE storage and UNDEF removal provide the required boundary directly. Argument-count validation, unrelated conversion/formatting commands, definition-list output and error cases unrelated to name resolution are omitted. Field declarations/constructors are retained only where positional construction or a custom constructor must be understood. The alternative of including only DEFINE is insufficient: it cannot establish exact-name precedence, prefix eligibility, or deletion behavior. Excerpt-only review: each of the four requirements is supported by the resolver ordering, rejection test, eligibility/storage fields, and targeted removal; no omitted Task A contract is used as evidence.

The excerpt contains 513 tokens under `metric/tokenizer.py`. Only complete source lines are counted; the question and this rationale are excluded. Task B uses the README assumption that the Task A program satisfies its contract; this selection does not claim compilation or runtime verification.
