# Task B selection — Lua

## Answer requirements shared across languages

1. Trace a valid RETURN of an existing loan with an already waiting reservation: command/date/member/title/loan checks, fine and history/loan closure, queue-head selection, and ordered RETURN/HOLD notices.
2. Locate new-hold construction, its stored owner/expiry and first-open-day calculation; identify the local plus-three to plus-five policy change without implementing it or recomputing previously stored expiries.
3. Follow DAY through the stored-expiry boundary: at expiry the hold remains valid; after expiry charge the correct member fee, remove the old hold, print EXPIRED, and release/reassign the copy using the same new-hold helper.

## Evidence and language semantics

Tables have reference identity. table.remove(queue,1) consumes the FIFO head; assigning nil removes a loan/hold association. Rules use one-based indices. DAY jumps to due/expiry events, including expiry+1; only holds whose stored expiry is less than day are charged/released. The queue is already populated in the question, so no RESERVE setup is required. The excerpt traces the valid RETURN path through validation, late fine/ledger/history and closure, then RETURN before HOLD. The new hold computes first-open(current day + 3), stores that date, and prints it. The requested local policy replacement is +3 to +5 only at this creation site. An already stored expiry E is not recomputed: DAY E retains the hold, DAY E+1 charges its previous owner, prints EXPIRED, and releases/reassigns it via the same helper. Closed-day adjustment belongs to creation; expiry processing uses the stored date, including an expiry+1 date that itself is closed.

Targeted internal-boundary review: The empty-queue guard ends before table.remove. Member next-boundary search and the target-day break guard end before clock assignment. Nested collection loops finish before charge/release, followed by separate expiry/day loop ends.

## Minimization and alternatives

Each retained source line supplies command routing or a required validation, identity/mutation rule, fine/history/ledger effect, FIFO selection, first-open calculation, stored boundary, or notice order. Existing reservation/loan setup, borrowing limits, unrelated reporting, payment, renewal, lost-copy handling and the full ISBN checksum parser are unnecessary for this valid existing-loan scenario. Blank lines and outer routine/class delimiters may be omitted when they add no answer evidence. Internal branch and loop boundaries are retained wherever they establish required reachability, iteration extent or notice order. A smaller set containing only the +3 expression would identify the local edit but could not establish closure, notice order, or non-retroactive expiry behavior; including all command handlers would add unrelated tokens. The selected creation and boundary lines together suffice without expanding the task to unrelated policy changes.

The excerpt contains 1695 tokens under `metric/tokenizer.py`. Only complete source lines are counted; the question and this rationale are excluded. Task B uses the README assumption that the Task A program satisfies its contract; this selection does not claim compilation or runtime verification.
