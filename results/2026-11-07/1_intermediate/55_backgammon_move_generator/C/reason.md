# Task B selection — C

## Answer requirements shared across languages

1. Trace numeric, bar and off PLAY syntax, optional hit marks/path repetition, and Black own-number to board-point correspondence.
2. Explain construction of a temporary proposed position, rule rejection and recognition by equality with generated legal plays.
3. Give a valid Black example and its final canonical notation, identifying success-only mutation and invalid/unmatched exits.

## Evidence and language semantics

parse_play maps bar25/off0 and decreasing numeric paths to own-coordinate Move pairs, with optional stars/repetition. Black point storage is checker[1][25-boardPoint]. choose_play modifies a by-value Position, resolves hits and rejects syntax/rules/unmatched positions; only the caller success branch invokes apply_play. make_notation sorts and joins the accepted legal play, not raw input. Numeric notation always uses the moving player's own numbering: Black own point p corresponds to board point25-p, with bar/off remaining special sentinels25/0 rather than ordinary reflected board points. For a Black position with the usual starting checkers and dice1,2, PLAY 1 2 6/4 6/5 requests own6->4 and6->5, i.e. board19->21 and19->20; both are legal, non-hitting moves using both dice. Descending source/target canonical order gives OK 6/5 6/4, independent of input token order. A proposed final position is isolated from current state; the returned/generated legal candidate supplies canonical notation and is committed only after all checks. The generator search itself is outside this parsing routine: its legal collection is consumed by exact complete-position comparison, so evaluation, dice search and game/match scoring are unnecessary to explain recognition or failure non-mutation.

## Minimization and alternatives

Each selected expression establishes a requested fact or its data dependency. The excerpt was read without unselected implementation details: removing the kind extraction, bounds/coordinate/default condition, state update, or output expression would lose that fact. A larger enclosing routine, unrelated commands, declarations with inferable types, and implementations of standard primitives were considered and excluded; no alternative smaller expression in this source establishes the same facts. Complete lines retain their original syntax even when one line includes incidental text.

The excerpt contains 3422 tokens under `metric/tokenizer.py`. Only complete source lines are counted; the question and this rationale are excluded. Task B uses the README assumption that the Task A program satisfies its contract; this selection does not claim compilation or runtime verification.
