# Task B selection — Kotlin

## Answer requirements shared across languages

1. Establish exact-symbol lookup before prefix decomposition, including the factor/dimension returned by a prefix match.
2. Connect DEFINE name rejection to the same resolver and explain why a name absent as an exact entry may still be taken.
3. Identify the restriction preventing prefixes on user-defined units.
4. Determine whether UNDEF of a referenced user unit changes another unit already defined from it, using stored factor/dimension and the deletion operation.

## Selected source locations

- `main.kt`: 111, 426, 427, 428, 429, 430, 431, 500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 505, 506, 507, 508, 509, 510, 511, 512, 513, 514, 515, 516, 653, 655, 656, 657, 659, 660, 663, 664, 667

## Evidence and language semantics

The non-local return from the exact firstOrNull branch precedes prefix decomposition; take(42) restricts suffix lookup to builtins. DEFINE constructs a Quantity and a separate Definition with prefix=false. removeAt does not recompute the remaining data-class instances.

## Minimization and alternatives

Compared with selecting the whole unit-expression parser or arithmetic library, the resolver plus DEFINE storage and UNDEF removal provide the required boundary directly. Argument-count validation, unrelated conversion/formatting commands, definition-list output and error cases unrelated to name resolution are omitted. Field declarations/constructors are retained only where positional construction or a custom constructor must be understood. The alternative of including only DEFINE is insufficient: it cannot establish exact-name precedence, prefix eligibility, or deletion behavior. Excerpt-only review: each of the four requirements is supported by the resolver ordering, rejection test, eligibility/storage fields, and targeted removal; no omitted Task A contract is used as evidence.

The excerpt contains 504 tokens under `metric/tokenizer.py`. Only complete source lines are counted; the question and this rationale are excluded. Task B uses the README assumption that the Task A program satisfies its contract; this selection does not claim compilation or runtime verification.
