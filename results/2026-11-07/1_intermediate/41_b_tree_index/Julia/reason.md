# Task B selection — Julia

## Answer requirements shared across languages

1. Resolve the question's command-name premise against actual source: identify the operation producing kids= and the actual DUMP serialization.
2. Trace the page-list operation from current nodes through ascending page order, bracketed key notation, leaf/internal child text and output.
3. Explain changing only the leaf child-text to [] while retaining internal page numbers, order, counters, cursor and PRINT.

## Selected source locations

- `main.jl`: 21, 293, 294, 295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 502, 503, 504, 505

## Evidence and language semantics

PAGES sorts Dict page keys and prints notation plus - for empty kids or comma-joined child pages. Change only this leaf literal. dump_tree and the DUMP branch serialize parentheses and entries separately. The Task B wording mismatches the source and Task A contract: the requested kids field belongs to PAGES, while DUMP is the tree-notation serialization. Therefore no DUMP leaf-kids branch exists to edit. The analogous requested change belongs only to PAGES' leaf child-text branch. Keep the node-notation formatter shared with PRINT, the traversal/page sort, all tree mutation/counter logic and cursor logic unchanged; these listing/serialization paths only accumulate or emit text.

## Minimization and alternatives

Actual DUMP dispatch and its necessary serializer are retained to establish the premise mismatch from source, rather than silently relabeling PAGES. PAGES traversal, child formatting and key notation are retained for the intended change. Ordered-map semantics replace explicit sorting code where applicable; node enumeration/notation helpers are included only when custom. B-tree search, balancing, allocation, snapshots and complete PRINT traversal add no needed edit evidence. No task definition or Task A source is changed.

The excerpt contains 348 tokens under `metric/tokenizer.py`. Only complete source lines are counted; the question and this rationale are excluded. Task B uses the README assumption that the Task A program satisfies its contract; this selection does not claim compilation or runtime verification.
