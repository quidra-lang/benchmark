# Task B selection — Python

## Answer requirements shared across languages

1. Establish the left-to-right message/codeword/syndrome bit convention from the actual text or packed-bit conversions, dimensions, and iteration indices.
2. Trace each message position to its generator row and XOR contribution for matrix encoding; derive how flipping a codeword position changes syndrome by the corresponding parity-check column.
3. Include the actual cyclic polynomial encoder and parity-check conversion where present, distinguishing systematic shifted-message/remainder encoding from direct generator-row selection while preserving the same column convention.

## Evidence and language semantics

The excerpt fixes a common high-order-first convention: the leftmost displayed bit occupies the highest power of two. Matrix ENCODE tests message bit i against generator row i and XORs that entire row. For any codeword position j, replacing w by w XOR 2^(n-1-j) toggles the parity for exactly those H rows whose j-th bit is 1; the syndrome difference is therefore column j of H, in H-row order. The syndrome fold shifts its previous value left before adding each row parity, so its first row is the leftmost output bit. A valid codeword has zero syndrome under the stipulated correct-code assumption. CYCLIC retains shifted polynomial generator rows but takes the separate systematic encoder branch: shift message by n-k, divide over GF(2), and combine the remainder. Its H construction divides each descending-power unit vector and appends the remainder bits as successive columns; this is why a flipped bit has the same position meaning in the polynomial representation. The selected division lines show cancellation by XOR at the degree difference; quotient accumulation is irrelevant to the selected remainder and is omitted.

Python enumerate(...,1) and bit(length-position) use one-based positions. int(text,2), format width, bit_count, integer shifts and XOR have their standard exact-integer meanings. transpose/column are included because they turn the remainder list into the stored parity-check rows.

## Minimization and alternatives

An encoder-only excerpt would miss H-row order and cannot justify the single-bit syndrome contribution. A syndrome-only excerpt would not establish which message bit selects which generator row. Omitting the cyclic conversion would wrongly suggest that every ENCODE uses direct generator-row summation. Conversely Gaussian elimination, code enumeration, decoding, leader tables, command-wide validation and unrelated constructors do not determine this interaction and are excluded. The retained tiny arithmetic/conversion loops each supply a required initialization, iteration order, contribution or return; brace-only/blank lines and unused quotient updates are omitted. An alternative selection could inline the relevant helper body at its call sites, but complete-line copying forbids rewriting, and repeating the same definition would increase cost. For matrix codes the correctness of H as a parity-check matrix follows the README valid-program assumption; no extra proof of the nullspace implementation is needed to explain indexing. Compared with 9efb28574 on byte-identical source. The Dart unused yes/no formatter and Quidra redundant dimension validation were removed; all remaining encoding/syndrome/parity witnesses are unchanged.

The excerpt contains 860 tokens under `metric/tokenizer.py`. Only complete source lines are counted; the question and this rationale are excluded. Task B uses the README assumption that the Task A program satisfies its contract; this selection does not claim compilation or runtime verification.
