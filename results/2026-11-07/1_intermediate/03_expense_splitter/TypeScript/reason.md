# Task B selection — TypeScript

## Answer requirements shared across languages

1. Trace a signed integer cent balance through sign selection, absolute-cent conversion and two-digit fraction formatting in BALANCES.
2. State the member-line representation for 7, -7 and 0 cents, including indentation.

## Selected source locations

- `main.ts`: 25, 26, 29, 30, 33, 34, 453, 455

## Evidence and language semantics

signed selects positive, negative with negation, or literal zero. money uses custom ratio, whose BigInt division truncates, and padStart(2) for cent remainder. Member text starts with two spaces. Thus the balance texts are +0.07, -0.07 and 0.00; with member name N the lines are "  N +0.07", "  N -0.07" and "  N 0.00".

## Minimization and alternatives

Only the member output line and its actual formatting dependencies are needed. Balance computation, active-member ordering and other reports are excluded because the input is already a signed integer cent balance. Custom quotient/padding/wrapper bodies are included where required; native abs, integer division, remainder and formatting use language/library semantics. The member-line literal is necessary to establish indentation independently of numeric formatting.

The excerpt contains 244 tokens under `metric/tokenizer.py`. Only complete source lines are counted; the question and this rationale are excluded. Task B uses the README assumption that the Task A program satisfies its contract; this selection does not claim compilation or runtime verification.
