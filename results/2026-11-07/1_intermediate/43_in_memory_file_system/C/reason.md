# Task B selection — C

## Answer requirements shared across languages

1. Trace one resolution from absolute/relative starting node through path components, including dot components and symbolic-link expansion.
2. Distinguish a missing original final component from a missing component during link expansion, including the absent/error payload and propagated result.
3. Show the creating command consuming the result: a creation location permits creation; identical missing-entry text without that location does not.

## Selected source locations

- `main.c`: 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 209, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230, 231, 232, 233, 234, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 244, 246, 247, 248, 250, 252, 254, 255, 256, 689, 690, 691, 692, 693, 694

## Evidence and language semantics

The designated-initializer omissions zero the node and creation-parent pointers. original is false in a link-target walk, so Missing has no creation parent there. A missing ordinary final name returns its containing directory and that name. A missing link target returns the same displayed missing-entry reason without that creation payload; the failure escapes before the remaining original path can be treated as creatable. Absolute targets start at root; relative targets start at the containing directory. The excerpt alone supplies traversal, the original/recursive flag transition, return payload, and touch acceptance/error branches. Standard splitting, map lookup, optional/null, and branch semantics require no library implementation.

## Minimization and alternatives

The creating-command branch alone cannot distinguish the two missing cases. The resolver alone does not establish whether its payload authorizes creation, so both are retained. Other commands, node size/content operations, allocation internals, and command parsing are irrelevant to this routine question. Constructors are retained only where needed to interpret omitted/default result fields; error-format mappings are retained where the same displayed message is indirect. Pure block delimiters, blank lines, expansion-limit checks, and unrelated successful-action work were omitted where the selected conditions and indentation preserve the required scope. A full resolver including loop-limit handling would cost more tokens without affecting the stipulated missing-path comparison; no proposed source change is made.

The excerpt contains 1073 tokens under `metric/tokenizer.py`. Only complete source lines are counted; the question and this rationale are excluded. Task B uses the README assumption that the Task A program satisfies its contract; this selection does not claim compilation or runtime verification.
